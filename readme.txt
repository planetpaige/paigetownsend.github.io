--Readme document for *Paige Townsend*, *pmtownse@uci.edu*--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone else’s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

9/10
- 1/1 Readme
- 2/2 Basic HTML content
- 1/1 Basic CSS styling
- 1/1 Advanced feature
- 1/2 Responsive layout
- 1/1 Passes validation checks
- 2/2 Embraces spirit of the assignment

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features
- At least one image, with descriptive alt attribute(s)
- Appropriate headings and paragraph text
- Links to external page(s)
- Adding custom icons from Google Material Icons, Font Awesome, or similar

(b) CSS features
- Modifying padding and margins to indent content and enhance readability
- Modifying link, text color, or other colors to be visually appealing, perhaps with one of the pallette creators in the resources tab
- Adding custom font(s) from Google fonts to add more personality (make sure to include appropriate fallbacks)

(c) Advanced features
- Creating a more complex page layout, such as including a sidebar or navigation bar
- Embedded HTML5 media, like video or audio, with fallbacks (through use of a Spotify iFrame embed)
- Hover effects on nav bar, project cards, socials, and experience
- Collapsible experience list

3. Did you ignore any of the warnings or errors presented by the accessibility checker? If so, why does this not seem like an accessibility concern? If it's useful, you can consolidate your thoughts on multiple warnings/errors if the rationale is similar.
Check 178 + 8: I accepted this warning because the surrounding headings and body text already gave the basic information, making additional detail in alt text repetative for assistive technology users.
Check 16: I did not change this because the images provide contextual value and are not purely decorative.
Check 271 + 270 + 110: I chose ignore this because the document contains only left to right English text with no directional changes.
Check 248: I did not refactor this because the visual groupings did not represent true list formatting for my site.
Check 241: I ignored this because no data is presented in a tabular format that would require table markup.
Check 250: I accepted this because my text does not require reliance on spatial positioning to understand.
Check 14: I didn't change this because my images are either simple headshots, or are accompanied by descriptive text.
Check 251 + 11: I ignored this since any text contained in images is decorative.
Check 86: I ignored this because icon meaning is conveyed through accessible labels rather than color alone.
Check 89: I ignored this because the Font Awesome script does not introduce interactive elements that would block keyboard access.
Check 87: I did not address this since the script does not introduce flashing or seizure-inducing behavior.
Check 28 + 184: I accepted this because the page is a short single-page layout with minimal navigation repetition.
Check 262: I ignored this because related links are already grouped in a clear and understandable navigation structure.
Check 54: I chose not to change this because the page title accurately reflects the purpose of the document.
Check 19: I accepted this since the link purposes are clear from context and standard navigation conventions.
Check 43: I ignored this because the h2 elements correctly reflect section structure rather than visual styling.
Check 276: I accepted this because navigation order and labeling remain consistent across the page.
Check 131: I ignored this since there are no long quotations that require blockquote markup.

4. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?
I think it took me about 12 hours or so off and on to complete the assignment.


5. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs, describe queries to Generative AI, or use of AI-based code completion)
- I submitted queries to Generative AI (ChatGPT) to help explain and fix some issues including being unable to get the projects cards and socials section evenly centered on the screen without hard coding gaps and padding,
as well as trying to debug the collapsible bars so that they would take up the full screen without creating overflow.

6. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
I talked to my boyfriend who is a full time software engineer to get some simple input on the visuals of the website.


7. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
No.
